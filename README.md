<h1>Battletech Company Emblems and Commander Portraits</h1>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/Amorano/BTEP/wiki">EMBLEM & PORTRAIT INDEX</a></h3>

<p>A set of company emblems and commander portraits to use in [Battletech](https://harebrained-schemes.com/battletech) by Harebrained Studios.</p>
<p>These were made to be used in the RogueTech's mod for [Battletech: RogueTech](http://roguewar.org/index).</p>
<p>These icons are [categorized into folders](https://github.com/Amorano/BTEP/wiki) with the main concept word that was used to generate their final image. They are 100% free to use.</p>

<h2>INSTALLATION</h2>

<p>The files are all provided in PNG format. This is so it can be easily transported or converted to other formats.</p>

<p>For Battletech icon use:
Emblems must be in DDS format with the orirentation upside down
Pilot files can be in DDS format with the orirentation upside down --or-- in normal PNG format with normal orientation</p>

<h2>The Gryphonheart Gift</h2>
<p>Because these are made generatively, sometimes they dont come out exactly as someone would like, especially when it comes to the background of the emblem or pilot icon.</p>
<p><b>As Gryphonheart pointed out when I first posted an example of the portraits: </b></p>
<blockquote><i>"Oh wow! Those are nice! Although i'd choose a different background. That white is bright as hell - IMO"</i></blockquote>
<p>He is not wrong, I would also choose better or transparent backgrounds (when available). SO...</p>
<p>Because this is not a normal code repository, I leave it mostly to everyone to shepard the icons how they would like; however, if you find a set of icons you would like adjusted to fit a theme or color palette, please make a ticket with the icon and adjustment you want to see.
I can then make a few runs of that and add the extras to the general pool for everyone.</p>
