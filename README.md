Custom Battletech Company Emblems and Commander Portraits

A set of company emblems and commander portraits to use in [Battletech](https://harebrained-schemes.com/battletech/) by Harebrained Studios.

These were first made to be used in Season 4 of the excellent user made modification for Battletech: [RogueTech](http://roguewar.org/index).

These icons are categorized into folders with the main concept word that was used to generate their final image.

They are 100% free to use.
