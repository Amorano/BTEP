<h1>Battletech Company Emblems and Commander Portraits</h1>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/Amorano/BTEP/wiki">EMBLEM & PORTRAIT INDEX</a></h3>

<p>A set of company emblems and commander portraits to use in <a href="https://harebrained-schemes.com/battletech">Battletech by Harebrained Studios</a>.</p>
<p>These were made to be used in the RogueTech's mod for <a href="http://roguewar.org/index">Battletech: RogueTech</a>.</p>
<p>These icons are <a href="https://github.com/Amorano/BTEP/wiki">categorized into folders</a> with the main concept word that was used to generate their final image.</p>
<p>Everything is 100% free to use.</p>

<h2>INSTALLATION</h2>

<p>The files are all provided in PNG format. This is so it can be easily transported or converted to other formats.</p>

<p>For Battletech icon use:
Format can either be kept in PNG format, or, changed to DDS format. It makes no difference except for orientation:

<h3>PILOTS</h3>

Custom Commander/Pilot portraits require the mod <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/84">Commander Portrait Loader</a>. If should either be <a href="https://roguetech.fandom.com/wiki/Installation#FX_Options">enabled in RogueTech</a>, or installed separately.

For RogueTech you can use the existing folder (if the CommanderPortraitLoader module enabled):

* BATTLETECH/Mods/Core/CommanderPortraitLoader/Portraits

If CommanderPortraitLoader installed separately, or disabled in RogueTech's modules:

* BATTLETECH/Mods/CommanderPortraitLoader/Portraits

<h4>FORMAT</h4>

Files for commanders can work as they are, from this repository, without change. Although you may want to fix certain things like colors or hair. Otherwise, files can be either of the following:

* PNG format with normal orientation
* DDS format but should have orientation upside down

<h3>EMBLEMS</h3>

For RogueTech you can use the existing folder (if you have any of the emblem modules enabled):

* BATTLETECH/Mods/Options/Emblems

If you dont have any of the emblem modules from RogueTech loaded, or want to use the default location provided by Harebrained Studios:

* BATTLETECH/BattleTech_Data/StreamingAssets/emblems/player

<h4>FORMAT</h4>

Emblem files can work as they are, from this repository, without change. Although you may want to fix certain things like color or background. Otherwise, files can be either of the following:

<h2>The Gryphonheart Gift</h2>
<p>Because these are made generatively, sometimes they dont come out exactly as someone would like, especially when it comes to the background of the emblem or pilot icon.</p>
<p><b>As Gryphonheart pointed out when I first posted an example of the portraits: </b></p>
<blockquote><i>"Oh wow! Those are nice! Although i'd choose a different background. That white is bright as hell - IMO"</i></blockquote>
<p>He is not wrong, I would also choose better or transparent backgrounds (when available). SO...</p>
<p>Because this is not a normal code repository, I leave it mostly to everyone to shepard the icons how they would like; however, if you find a set of icons you would like adjusted to fit a theme or color palette, please make a ticket with the icon and adjustment you want to see.
I can then make a few runs of that and add the extras to the general pool for everyone.</p>
